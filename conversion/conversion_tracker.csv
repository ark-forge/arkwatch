# - Add one row per lead
# - Update status as lead progresses through funnel
# - Status values: qualified, contacted, replied, no_reply, trial_active, invoice_sent, converted_paid, trial_expired_no_conversion
# - demo_done: yes/no
# - conversion_days: number of days from capture_date to paid_date
# - Use ISO 8601 format for dates (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)

# Status definitions:
# - qualified: Lead validated (real email, not test)
# - contacted: First email sent
# - replied: Lead responded positively
# - no_reply: No response after 3+ days

# - converted_paid: Payment received, subscription active
# - trial_expired_no_conversion: Trial ended without payment

# KPIs to calculate:
# - Conversion rate = converted_paid / contacted
# - Avg response time = contacted_date - capture_date
# - Avg conversion time = paid_date - capture_date
# - Demo impact = conversion rate (demo_done=yes) vs (demo_done=no)
