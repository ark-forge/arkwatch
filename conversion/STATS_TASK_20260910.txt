Medium risk (P2):

  Mitigation: Clear JSON structure for updates
- ⚠️ Cold email bounce/spam risk
  Mitigation: Low volume + personalization + backup LinkedIn

Low risk (P3):
- ⚠️ Response rate uncertainty (no historical data)
  Mitigation: Multi-channel increases chances
- ⚠️ Timeline pressure (6 phases in 7 days)
  Mitigation: Clear priorities (P0/P1/P2)

Risk score: 🟡 MEDIUM (manageable with mitigations)
